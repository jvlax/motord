## Architecture

### Components
- `useMobile()` hook: Device detection and screen size monitoring
- `MobileGameScreen`: Mobile-optimized game interface
- `MobileLobbyScreen`: Mobile-optimized lobby with tabbed layout

### Device Detection
- Mobile: < 768px width
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px width  
- Desktop: > 1024px width
- Touch detection for enhanced UX

## Testing Instructions

### Local Development
```bash
# Start the application (uses Docker)
docker compose up -d

# Access the application
# Desktop: http://localhost:3000
# Mobile: Use Chrome DevTools device simulation or access from mobile device on local network
```

### Mobile Testing
1. **Chrome DevTools**: 
   - Open DevTools â†’ Toggle device toolbar
   - Select mobile device (iPhone, Android)
   - Test touch interactions and responsive layout

2. **Real Device Testing**:
   - Connect mobile device to same network
   - Access via local IP: `http://[YOUR_IP]:3000`
   - Test actual touch interactions and mobile keyboard

3. **PWA Installation**:
   - Open in mobile browser
   - Use "Add to Home Screen" option
   - Test standalone app experience

## Game Flow (Mobile)

### Lobby (Mobile)
1. **Players Tab**: View all players with ready status and language flags
2. **Chat Tab**: Full-screen chat with fixed input at bottom
3. **Settings Tab**: Host controls for difficulty and max score
4. **Action Bar**: Ready toggle, Start Game, and Invite buttons

### Game (Mobile)  
1. **Scoreboard**: Horizontal scrolling leaderboard at top
2. **Word Display**: Centered word with appropriate sizing
3. **Fuse Timer**: Visual countdown bar below word
4. **Input Area**: Fixed at bottom with optional submit button
5. **Touch Optimizations**: Disabled autocorrect, enhanced focus handling

## Technical Details

### Mobile Detection Logic
```typescript
const isMobile = width < 768
const isTablet = width >= 768 && width < 1024
const isDesktop = width >= 1024
const isTouchDevice = 'ontouchstart' in window || navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Uses Tailwind CSS breakpoints (md: 768px, lg: 1024px)
- Dynamic text sizing based on device and orientation
- Adaptive layouts for different screen aspects

### PWA Configuration
- Manifest file with app metadata
- Apple-specific meta tags for iOS
- Theme colors and orientation preferences
- Icon definitions for various sizes

## Development Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Desktop version remains unchanged
- Mobile components are additive, not replacing existing functionality  
- Same backend API and WebSocket infrastructure

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of mobile components when needed
- Efficient re-rendering on orientation changes
- Optimized touch event handling

### Future Enhancements
- Gesture support (swipe actions)
- Offline mode capabilities
- Push notifications for game invites
- Native app builds (Capacitor/PhoneGap)
