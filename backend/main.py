# Motord backend
#
# HuggingFace model cache location can be controlled with the following environment variables:
#   - HF_HOME: sets the root cache directory for HuggingFace (default: ~/.cache/huggingface)
#   - TRANSFORMERS_CACHE: sets the cache directory for model files (default: $HF_HOME/hub or $HF_HOME/xet)
#
# If you want to bundle models in Docker, set these envs in your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml to point to the correct location.
